<h1>Lorikeet Plugin Example</h1>

<div>
    Lorikeet can display custom neutral losses and multiple neutral losses per amino acid.
    <br>
    The default is to have one neutral loss per amino acid, but you can set it to a higher number with the
    following option:
    <br>
    <pre>
        maxNeutralLossCount: 2
    </pre>
    Custom potential losses at a residue can be specified in the modification options, as the losses array.
    <br>
    <pre>
